# Machine_Learning_Algorithms
In this repo, the ML algorithms are implemented using only built-in Python modules and mathematical libraries. 


The concept and the math behind these popular ML algorithms is also covered.


LINEAR REGRESSION:
1.Linear Regression Gradient Descent implementation using Numpy in Python.
2.Linear Regression Stochastic Gradient Descent implementation using Numpy in Python.
3.house_dataset.csv is an example of the dataset that has been used in the above implementations. 


LOGISTIC REGRESSION
1.LOGISTIC Regression, Gradient Descent implementation using Numpy in Python.
2.Trial Dataset containing customers information.
